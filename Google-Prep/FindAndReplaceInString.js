/*
To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace
groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).

Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word
x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the
original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not,
we do nothing.

For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some replacement operation i = 2,
x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts at position 2 in the original
string S, we will replace it with "ffff".

Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement operation
i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement operation i = 2,
x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing because in the original
string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.

All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be
any overlap in replacement: for example, S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1],
sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case.

Example:
    Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], 
        targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
    Output: "eeebffff"
    Explanation:
    "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
    "cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".
