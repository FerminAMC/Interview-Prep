/*
There are N workers.  The i-th worker has a quality[i] and a minimum wage
expectation wage[i].

Now we want to hire exactly K workers to form a paid group. When hiring a
group of K workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:

    * Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their
        quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
    * Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage
        expectation.

Return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the
above conditions.

Example: 
    Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], K = 2
    Output: 105.00000
    Explanation: We pay 70 to 0-th worker and 35 to 2-th worker.
